#we can change in list but not in Tuples 
#after creating a tuples we can't change it 

#creating a Tuple using ( )
t = (1,4,5,8,6,9)
t1 = ()      #empty tuple
t2 = (5,)    #tuple with only one element which needs one ','  wrong way is t2 = (5)


#Method/function in Tuples
print(t.count(1))    #count number of occurance of any element in the tuple
print(t.index(5))    #find index of the first occurrence of the element in Tuples
